Tasks
----

 1. list of numbers 3^x where x = (0...9)
 2. list of numbers -x where x = (0...499) and x is divided by 2 or 3
 3. sum of squares numbers x % 7 = 0 and x % 11 = 1 where x = (0...1499)
 4. there is tuple = ("krzysiu", "socek", "faja", "wyplata") , from this tuple make dictonary where elements from tuple are uppercase and they are keys for values let be lengts of keys
 5. make generator that return number from 0 to 9, if number is 7 then should end generating
 6. make generator for calculate sum of elements
 7. there is class:
 
        class Pizza(object):
            name = None
            d = 0.0  # cm

            def __init__(self, name, d):
                self.name = name
                self.d = d
Generate all pizzas with names ananas, papaja, margarita and sizes 5, 10, 20
8. generate list of tuples where [(sin(x), cos(y))] for x,y = (0..49)
9. from previous task generate {int(sin(x) * i): sin(x) / cos(y)) where i is integer number starts from 0
